= TDD Kata @ Agile Greece Summit

The purpose of this code kata is an introduction to the basic flow of TDD.

To do this, we will use a slight variation of the `FizzBuzz` problem:

----
Write a "fizzBuzz" method that accepts a number as input and returns it
as a String.
BUT for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and
for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
